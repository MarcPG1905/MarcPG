# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with passion and the owner of both [PegOS](https://github.com/Peg-OS) and [Hectus](https://github.com/HectusNet).

## Current Projects

- **Peelocity** - VelocityMC Plugin with all kinds of features.
- **Invade** - A unique game mode for the Hectus Network.
- **LibPG & HectusUtilities** - Private Java-Libraries for other projects.
- **BotPG v2** - New and better version of the old BotPG.
- **Wizard Duels** - Plugin for another Minecraft server's game mode.
- **PegBoot** - Bootloader for PegOS, written in Assembly and Rust.
- **PegOS Core** - Main components for PegOS.

## Programming Languages

- **Java/Kotlin**: My most used language which I'm most experienced with.
- **Rust**: My other main language, which I'm very familiar with.
- **Assembly**: x86_64, ARM, IA-64 and probably some other's that are similar.
- **C/C++**: Pretty decent at it.
- **C#**: Made some games with it, but nothing too serious.
- **Python**: Worked with it before and decent at it.
