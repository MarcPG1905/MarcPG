# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with passion and the owner of some projects, like [Hectus](https://github.com/HectusNet) and [PooperMC](https://github.com/MarcPG1905/PooperMC).

## Current Projects

- **PooperMC** - An all-in-one Minecraft plugin for any server.
- **Invade** - A unique game mode for the Hectus Network.
- **LibPG** - A library with a wide range of utilities, such as Time, Formatting, Formulars, etc.
- **BotPG v2** - New and better version of the old BotPG.
- **Wizard Duels** - Plugin for another Minecraft server.

## Programming Languages

- **Java**: My most used language which I'm most experienced with.
- **Rust**: My other main language, which I'm very familiar with.
- **Assembly**: x86_64, ARM, IA-64 and likely some other's that are similar.
- **C/C++**: Pretty decent at it.
